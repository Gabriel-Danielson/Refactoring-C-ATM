Unit Testing -

  Unit testing is when someone creates a program with the purpose of testing a specific method or class. Usually, these programs do this by calling the method being tested with the proper data as its parameters and seeing what the result is. If the output is what's expected, the method works correctly. If not, then the method does not work correctly. People create unit tests because they are beneficial in ensuring that the code will be working properly, even after changes are made to the program. If it does not work, then the unit test failing notifies the programmers that something is wrong so they can fix it immediately. Because it is creating a method to do this testing, the tests can be done repeatedly, with very little management being required.
